# ry.sb URL shortener
This is my personal URL shortener built entirely on top of Netlify redirects.

## Current URLs
See the [`_redirects`](/_redirects) file for shortened URLs.

## Submit a new URL
Just open a pull request on Github, making the changes you want to `_redirects` file.

Be aware that your redirects might be modified/removed in the future if it collides with a path I potentially want (say we both want /home to point to our homepages, then I'll just take over)

## License
Doesn't matter.
